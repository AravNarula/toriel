# Toriel

_Just a lil' ol greeter bot to direct new members joining the Hack Club Slack. You wonder what she might say..._

![Toriel DMing you about how to change Slack themes](https://cloud-nk3pf3qvy-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2screen_shot_2022-04-07_at_11.06.08.png)

_Toriel is a fork of [Clippy](https://github.com/hackclub/clippy)._

## Running locally

Contributions are encouraged and welcome!

In order to run Toriel locally, you'll need to [join the Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack). From there, ask @msw to be added to the Toriel app on Slack.

1. Clone this repository
    `git clone https://github.com/hackclub/clippy && cd clippy`
2. Install [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) (if you haven't already)
3. Install dependencies
    `npm install`
4. Create `.env` file
    - `touch .env`
    - Send a message mentioning `@creds` in [Hack Club's Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/) asking for the `.env` file
5. Start server
    `npm run dev`
6. Forward your local server to ngrok
    `ngrok http 3000`
7. If you are creating your own Slack app to test with, update the settings in the manifest.yml
    - Change the slash command and event endpoints from https://toriel.hackclub.com to your ngrok URL.
    - Change the app and bot name from `TORIEL` to something that doesn't start with `T` (ex. `msw-dev-toriel`). This prevents Slack's auto-suggestions from confusing new users.
    - Change the slash commands from `/toriel-COMMAND` to something that doesn't start with `t` (ex. `/toriel-restart` -> `/msw-dev-restart`).

**Formatting** is important, please run `npm run fmt` on contribution.
