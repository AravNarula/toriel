            > Oh hello... I don't think I recognize you.
            > ...you must be new in town.
            > you may call me <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>! i have tea and butterscotch pie cooling off, please come over.
            
            > i just sent you a dm, you can tell by the :ping: to the left
            
            > (grumpy) ah, looks like that other bot is also messaging you. go ahead and ignore the other ping

basement-join: You don't want to stay? I understand, my child. You are looking for something more.
basement-join-2: I hope you find what you're looking for out there.
basement-join-3: Here, take this cellphone. You can call me anytime you're feeling lonely or just need to chat with someone \`/toriel-call\`.

house:
  hello: Hello my child, you may stay here with me for as long as you want.
  venture: But I imagine youâ€™d like to venture forward, as many before you have doneâ€¦
  beforeGo: Oh, but we don't have to get into that right now. Let's find something fun to keep you busy. Would you like to help me paint the house?

    Maybe you'll like these colors?

    > Thou shan't be a dick
    > Thou shaln't advertise or spam
    > Thou shall spread the positive vibes
    _You close the book at put it back on the shelf. You're not sure what you expected._
    _As you place it back on the shelf you see a link on the binding of the book: https://conduct.hackclub.com._
  game: |
    Ah, you're already done reading!?
    No, of course it's not a problem, my child. I just wasn't expecting you to go through it so quickly.
    You have free range in the house, just please don't open the door to <#${this.t('channels.the-basement')}>
    Maybe you can occupy yourself with one of the boardgames we have in the living room?
    I personally enjoy <#${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}> and <#${this.t('channels.tetris')}>
  basement: Whatever you do, please don't open the door to <#${this.t('channels.the-basement')}>

      You only wanted to say hello...? Well then.
      'Hello!'
      I hope that suffices. Hee hee.
    - |
      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You wanted to say hello again?
      'Salutations!'
      Is that enough?

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      I should have given you some <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.wordle')}|games> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}|to> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.uno-games')}|play>.
      My apologies.
      Why not user your imagination to divert yourself?

      Hello, my child.
      Sorry, I do not have much to say.
      It was nice to hear your voice, though.

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You want to know more about me?
      Well, I am afraid there is not much to say.
      I am just a silly little lady who wants to help everyone!

      Are you bored?
      We could paint the walls at my house ${this.t('themes')}
      Or, if you prefer another color, you can find one for yourself in <#${this.t('channels.slack-themes')}>
