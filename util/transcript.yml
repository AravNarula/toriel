        (neutral) Hello my child, you may stay here with me for as long as you want.
        (sad) But I imagine youâ€™d like to venture forward, as many before you have doneâ€¦

      You only wanted to say hello...? Well then.
      'Hello!'
      I hope that suffices. Hee hee.

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You wanted to say hello again?
      'Salutations!'
      Is that enough?

      Are you bored?
      I should have given you some <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.wordle')}|games> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}|to> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.uno-games')}|play>.
      My apologies.
      Why not user your imagination to divert yourself?

      Hello, my child.
      Sorry, I do not have much to say.
      It was nice to hear your voice, though.

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You want to know more about me?
      Well, I am afraid there is not much to say.
      I am just a silly little lady who wants to help everyone!

      We could paint the walls at my house.
